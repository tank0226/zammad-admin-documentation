.. Warning:: By default Zammad has an auto reply trigger activated. This trigger will reply to **all incoming emails** and reply to them!

By default, every time a customer creates a new ticket, they automatically 
receive a confirmation email to assure them that their issue has been received
successfully. This trigger can be deactivated at any time if needed.

Triggers are very flexible and can help to achieve various things. 
You may want to check out some of our :doc:`/manage/trigger/examples`.
