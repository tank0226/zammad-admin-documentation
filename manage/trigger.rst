Triggers
========

Use triggers to set up all kinds of 🎛️ **if-this-then-that** automation workflows.

.. hint:: For ⏳ **every-so-often** automation workflows,
   try :doc:`schedulers </manage/scheduler>` instead.

The first thing to know about triggers is that **you're already using them**.
From the moment you set up Zammad, it starts sending auto-replies
to all incoming emails. Recognize this line?

It means that the ticket is from an incoming customer email,
and that the customer received this message in response:

This auto-reply message is a **trigger**.
You can disable it, modify it, or create new ones
for all sorts of automation tasks on the Trigger page of the admin panel:
