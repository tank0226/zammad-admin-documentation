To get you up and running quickly, here are some examples of the kinds of
automation tasks you can set up with triggers. If they don't make sense to
you, don't worry—just skip ahead to :doc:`/manage/trigger/conditions-and-actions` 
to learn about all the options in detail, then come back here to see them in action.

1. Any time Jacob Smith creates a ticket, assign it to the Sales group:

2. Emma Taylor is responsible for all sales internally, so if a new ticket has
   the word “order” in the subject, assign it to her and make sure it’s set
   with a high priority:

3. Send an auto-reply email to *anyone* who responds to a ticket:
